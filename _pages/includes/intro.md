Greetings!&nbsp;&nbsp;

I'm Ziyi Zhao, a prospective Ph.D. candidate at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), scheduled to commence my studies in September 2023. I am excited to be joining the 
[Computational Intelligence and Brain-Computer Interface Lab (CIBCI)](https://uts-cibci.center/about-the-centre/), where I will be working at the intersection of Digital Humans and Generative Models under the guidance of [Prof. Chin-Teng Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin) and [Dr. YK Wang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YuKai.Wang).

In June 2023, I earned my Master's degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Tongji University, mentored by [Porf. Lei Wang](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/10451.htm).  Prior to that, I had the enriching experience of being an exchange student at EPFL in Switzerland, collaborating with [Porf. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua) and [Dr. Sena Kiciroglu](https://senakicir.github.io/) at the [CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) <img src='./images/logo-epfl.png' style='width: 3em;'/>. My academic journey began at Jilin University, where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2020.

My research interest is centered on **computer vision** and **generative AI**, I am enthusiastic about delving into the fascinating realms of **motion generation** research and **diffusion models**, and I look forward to contributing meaningfully to these fields during my Ph.D. journey at UTS. 

I have published 2 papers

Besides, I also hold a patent for an invention.
