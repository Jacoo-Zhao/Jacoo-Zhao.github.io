Greetings!&nbsp;&nbsp;

This is Ziyi Zhao, a Ph.D.student at UTS (University of Technology Sydney). I am excited to be a member of the [HAI Center (Human-Centric Artificial Intelligence)](https://www.uts.edu.au/research/human-centric-artificial-intelligence-centre), where I am working at the intersection of **EEG Decoding** and **Deep Learning** under the guidance of [Prof. Chin-Teng Lin](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Chin-Teng.Lin) and [Dr. YK Wang](https://profiles.uts.edu.au/YuKai.Wang).

In June 2023, I earned my Master's degree from the School of Electronic and Information Engineering at Tongji University, mentored by [Porf. Lei Wang](https://see.tongji.edu.cn/info/1379/10451.htm).  Prior to that, I was an exchange student at EPFL in Switzerland, collaborating with [Porf. Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/pascal.fua) and [Dr. Sena Kiciroglu](https://senakicir.github.io/) at the [CVLab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/) <img src='./images/logo-epfl.png' style='width: 3em;'/>. My academic journey began at Jilin University, where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2020.

My research interest is centered on **brain wave decoding**, **deep learning algorithm** and **generative AI**, I am enthusiastic about delving into the fascinating realms of eeg transcription research and  large generative models. Honestly, I look forward to contributing  to these fields during my Ph.D. journey at UTS. 

I have published 2 papers in the field of Human Motion Modelling and Music Generation. Besides, I also hold a patent for an program invention.
